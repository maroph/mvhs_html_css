        <p>
            You say you love me but you never beep me<br/>
            You always promise but you never date me<br/>
            I try to fax but it's busy, always<br/>
            I try the network but you crash the gateways<br/>
            You never spend your nights with me<br/>
            You don't go out with other girls either<br/>
            You only love your collider<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            I fill your screen with hearts and roses<br/>
            I fill your mail file with lovely phrases<br/>
            They all come back: "invalid user"<br/>
            You never let me into your computer<br/>
            You never spend your nights with me<br/>
            You don't go out with other girls either<br/>
            You prefer your collider<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            I gave you a golden ring to show you my love<br/>
            You went to stick it in a printed circuit<br/>
            To fix a voltage leak in your collector<br/>
            You plug my feelings into your detector<br/>
            You never spend your nights with me<br/>
            You don't go out with other girls either<br/>
            You prefer your collider<br/>
            You only love your collider<br/>
            Your collider.<br/>
