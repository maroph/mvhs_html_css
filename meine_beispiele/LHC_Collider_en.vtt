00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Music Intro)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You say you love me but you never beep me

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You always promise but you never date me

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I try to fax but it's busy, always

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I try the network but you crash the gateways

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You never spend your nights with me

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You don't go out with other girls either

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You only love your collider

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I fill your screen with hearts and roses

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I fill your mail file with lovely phrases

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They all come back: "invalid user"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You never let me into your computer

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You never spend your nights with me

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You don't go out with other girls either

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You prefer your collider

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I gave you a golden ring to show you my love

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You went to stick it in a printed circuit

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
To fix a voltage leak in your collector

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You plug my feelings into your detector

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You never spend your nights with me

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You don't go out with other girls either

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You prefer your collider

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Your collider.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Your collider.
